PLEASE CREATE AN avatar.png FILE HERE

This should be a default avatar image (40x40px or larger, square format recommended).

The file should be named: avatar.png

If you don't have an avatar image, you can:
1. Use any square image file and rename it to avatar.png
2. Or the system will use a placeholder automatically if the file is missing
